# JavaTicTacToe
TicTacToe board created using Java and the IntelliJ IDE.

This tic tac toe board can be scaled and have games that are larger than just a 3x3 board. This project uses requirement clauses, ensures clauses, and string theory theory to practice writing functions and programs that other users could implement without much thought.
